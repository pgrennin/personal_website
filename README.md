# About 

This site is a static website that uses Jekyll to generate static assets


Since Jekyll is a static site generator, it has to build the site before we can view it. Run either of the following commands to build your site:

`jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site.


`jekyll serve` - Does jekyll build and runs it on a local web server at http://localhost:4000, rebuilding the site any time you make a change.
